# AWS Amplify React Tutorial

This walkthrough expands on the [AWS Amplify Getting Started tutorial for ReactJS](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/react). 

> My detailed notes on building the demo from scratch is in [README-BUILD.md](./README-BUILD.md)

## 0. Verify developer workstation prereqs.

Same prereqs as listed in the official docs. Briefly:
* Node.js v10.x or later
* npm v5.x or later
* git v2.14.1 or later
* AWS Account
* AWS Amplify CLI

## 1. Initialize project

Clone this repo, cd into the repo directory, and initialize the project.
```sh
amplify init
amplify push
yarn install
```
